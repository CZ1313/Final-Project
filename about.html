        <p id="About_Paragraph">My name is Christina, but I also go by Chris. I am a artist at heart. I have used many different
        mediums such as charcoal, color pencils, ink and even woodburning! I also dabble in photography,
        digital art especially using photoshop and make stickers using my cricut. I went to Academy of Art University in
        San Francisco, CA majoring in visual effects for film. I was lucky enough to work on two films while attending. 
        <br>
        <br>
        However, life had other plans for me, so I wasn't able to pursue a career in that field right after graduation.
        I went on to learn graphic design at my local community college, College of the Sequoias, CA, 
        while working full time as a office assistant in my hometown. I sometimes refer to myself as a jack-of-all trades!
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently I am seeing where life may take me next and exploring other potential opportunities. In my spare time I am currently
        brushing up on my compositing skills and have begun to learn more about coding.
